## Usage

![Usage-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josdemmers/LiveAppsOverlay/refs/heads/master/readme/readme-001.png)

First select the app you want as overlay and click the + button to add it to your favorites.

![Usage-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josdemmers/LiveAppsOverlay/refs/heads/master/readme/readme-002.png)

Select one of the apps from favorites to start creating an overlay. Click the + button and enter a name for the thumbnail. You can add as many thumbnails as you want for an overlay.

![Usage-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josdemmers/LiveAppsOverlay/refs/heads/master/readme/readme-003.png)

You will now see two new windows. A config window and a thumbnail that is part of the overlay.
Use `Drag Mode` to move the thumbnail around or `Region Mode` if you want to modify the thumbnail to only view a part of it.

![Usage-4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josdemmers/LiveAppsOverlay/refs/heads/master/readme/readme-004.png)

With `Region Mode` enabled the thumbnail will show guide lines to create a region. If you make a mistake you can right-click the thumbnail and press reset.

![Usage-5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josdemmers/LiveAppsOverlay/refs/heads/master/readme/readme-005.png)

When done you can use the config window to turn off edit mode. This makes the thumbnail click-through so it does not interfere with other applications. You can also configure a hotkey to toggle edit mode on/off.
